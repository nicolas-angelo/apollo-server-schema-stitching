# Hasura GraphQL Remote on Apollo Server on Heroku

I use Hasura GraphQL Engine on Heroku and I have a number of remote schemas from 3rd party services connected.
I was facing "duplicate type name(s)" errors when trying to connect my Hasura GQL endpoint to Apollo Studio.

So I created a remote executable schema from Hasura.
Now I connect this endpoint to Apollo Studio as a proxy.
